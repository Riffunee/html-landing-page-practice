# HTML Landing Page Practice

This is a simple landing page project built as part of my front-end learning process.

In this project, I focused on:
- Writing clean semantic HTML
- Structuring sections properly
- Using article elements correctly
- Building a basic contact form with proper labels

This project is part of my effort to strengthen my HTML foundation before moving deeper into CSS.
